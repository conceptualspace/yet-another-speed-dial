## FAQ

### How do I add a Speed Dial?
Just bookmark/favorite a site to your *Speed Dial* folder -- from the browser toolbar, a page context menu, or keyboard shortcut (usually Ctrl+D). You can also add a site directly from the new tab page. YASD will fetch thumbnails for it automatically if it can.

### How do I make changes to a Speed Dial?
Right-click the dial and select Edit to change the image, title, or URL.

### How do I backup and restore my data?
Speed dials are browser bookmarks, so first, use the bookmark manager or browser sync to back them up. Then, to backup or restore your YASD settings and thumbnails, use the "Import and Export" feature in the YASD settings menu.

### Can I import from another speed dial extension?
YASD currently supports importing sites from FVD and Speed Dial 2, but YASD will fetch its own thumbnails. If there is another extension you want YASD to support please feel free to request it on Github.

### One of my thumbnails is blank?
You can try fetching new images: right-click the dial and select "Refresh thumbnails". Alternatively, you can edit the dial and attach your own image.

### Can I fetch new images for all my speed dials at once?
You can refresh all the dials in a given folder. Just right-click on the page and select "Refresh All". *Caution*: this will replace any existing images and may take a few minutes to complete.

### Can I move multiple dials or folders at once?
Yes, since dials are just bookmarks you can arrange them in the bookmarks manager. Look for the *Other Bookmarks > Speed Dial* folder.

### I want new sites to appear at the bottom of the page and not the top
You can change this preference in *Settings > Sort*

### Can I open speed dial links in a background tab?
Yes, just use Command + Click or Middle Click (depending on your OS).

### Can I open speed dial links in Firefox Containers?
Yes, just use Shift + Right-click on the speed dial to access the default context menu.

### Can I use YASD in a Chrome Incognito window?
Unfortunately, Google Chrome does not allow extensions to change the new tab page of Incognito windows. If you are a heavy user of Incognito mode, I would suggest trying Firefox, which does not have the limitation.

### Can I help to sponsor this project?
Sure! See my github profile: [https://github.com/sponsors/conceptualspace](https://github.com/sponsors/conceptualspace)
